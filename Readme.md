# A JSON parser

A C99 compliant json parser. Supports a subset of the [json specification](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)

## Todo

- support deallocating memory
- add error detection and recovery
- support decimal numbers
- add higher level for iterations and so on.
- what about creating json?

## Testing

Compile tests with `make test` and run `./test`. If all goes well, it'll say "Tests OK!". If not, it'll greet you with assertion failures.
